## Ludobots

This project follows rhe ludobots tutorial as outlined [here]([https://www.reddit.com/r/ludobots/wiki/hillclimber/)

The project uses the pyrogym simulation environment to create a robot that can evolve to exhibit improved gaits. The brief for this project was to complete up to part K - as such our robot shows signs of locomotion and uses neural networks based on a random seed to cause movement.
